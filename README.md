# Bank-System
This is my first OOP project: a Python-based Bank Management System that provides two versions: 1. Console-based version (Non-GUI) 2. GUI version built with Tkinter  It supports Savings and Checking accounts, deposits/withdrawals, fund transfers, account search, and password authentication.
